Hi! I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Internet of Things (IoT) Thrust at <a href="https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn">The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)</a>. I am also a Cross-Campus Faculty Affiliate at HKUST. I obtained my PhD degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg) in Sep. 2022, advised by [Prof. Vincent Y. F. Tan](https://vyftan.github.io/index.html). Before joining HKUST(GZ), I was a postdoc in the Center for Applied Mathematics at <a href="https://cam.cornell.edu">Cornell University</a>, working with [Prof. Ziv Goldfeld](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/zivg/) from [ECE](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece) and [Prof. Christina Lee Yu](https://cleeyu.orie.cornell.edu) from [ORIE](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie). I was honored to be funded by the [Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam) postdoctoral fellowship. 

My recent research interests lie in the intersection of **information theory** and **machine learning**, including but not limited to:
- Machine learning and statistical learning theory 
- Hypothesis testing
- Inference and estimation
- Wireless communications

**If you are interested in collaborating with me, please do not hesitate to drop me an email (at the bottom) or drop by my office &nbsp;<tt>W3-604</tt> &nbsp;!**

  üí° I am looking for highly motivated PhD/Mphil students and research assistants to join my group. If you are interested in exploring the intersection of information theory, machine learning, and statistics -- and have a reasonably strong background in mathematics or programming (or a strong interest in developing one) -- please feel free to reach out. 
  <br><br>
  To apply, please send an email with your CV, transcript, and a brief statement of your research interests. Use the subject line: <code>[Year]-[PhD/Mphil/RA Application]-[Your Name]</code>, e.g., <code>25Fall-PhD Application-Haiyun He</code>.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
