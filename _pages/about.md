Hi! I am currently a postdoc at Cornell University, working with [Prof. Ziv Goldfeld](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/zivg/) from [ECE](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece) and [Prof. Christina Lee Yu](https://cleeyu.orie.cornell.edu) from [ORIE](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie). I am honored to be funded by the [Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam) postdoctoral fellowship. Before joining Cornell, I obtained my PhD degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg) in Oct. 2022, advised by [Prof. Vincent Y. F. Tan](https://vyftan.github.io/index.html).

My recent research interests lie in the intersection of information theory and machine learning, including but not limited to:
- Hypothesis testing
- Inference and estimation
- Machine learning and statistical learning theory 
- Wireless communications

**If you are interested in collaborating with me, please do not hesitate to drop me an email (at the bottom) or drop by &nbsp;<tt>657 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY</tt> &nbsp;!**
